aders in other Markdown files. Use `inherit` to inherit the `fragmentLinks` setting.
    - `ignoredLinks` — Array of glob patterns for files that should not be validated.
    - `unusedLinkDefinitions`
      - `enabled` — Enable/disable validation of unused link definitions.
    - `duplicateLinkDefinitions`
      - `enabled` — Enable/disable validation of duplicated link definitions.

### Custom requests

To support all of the features of the language server, the client needs to implement a few custom request types. The definitions of these request types can be found in [`protocol.ts`](./src/protocol.ts)

#### `markdown/parse`

Get the tokens for a Markdown file. Clients are expected to use [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for this.

We require that clients bring their own version of Markdown-it so that they can customize/extend Markdown-it.

#### `markdown/fs/readFile`

Read the contents of a file in the workspace.

#### `markdown/fs/readDirectory`

Read the contents of a directory in the workspace.

#### `markdown/fs/stat`

Check if a given file/directory exists in the workspace.

#### `markdown/fs/watcher/create`

Create a file watcher. This is needed for diagnostics support.

#### `markdown/fs/watcher/delete`

Delete a previously created file watcher.

#### `markdown/findMarkdownFilesInWorkspace`

Get a list of all markdown files in the workspace.

## Contribute

The source code of the Markdown language server can be found in the [VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) at [extensions/markdown-language-features/server](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/markdown-language-features/server).

File issues and pull requests in the [VSCode GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues). See the document [How to Contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) on how to build and run from source.

Most of the functionality of the server is located in libraries:

- [vscode-markdown-languageservice](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-markdown-languageservice) contains the implementation of all features as a reusable library.
- [vscode-languageserver-node](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node) contains the implementation of language server for NodeJS.

Help on any of these projects is very welcome.
